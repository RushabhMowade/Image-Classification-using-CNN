# ***Image-Classification-using-CNN***<br>

 Build an ML model to classify the image as a dog or cat on the basis of their pixel values using CNN<br>
--if we plot the accuracy on training data and validation data with respective to each epochs we will notice that after 3rd - 4th epoch the validation accuracy starts to decline <br>
--to improve it we will need to fine tune the model by defining the no of kernals to use in each Convolutional layer or use methods like EarlyStopping
